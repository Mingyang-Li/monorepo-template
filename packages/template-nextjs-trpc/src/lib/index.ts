/**
 * This is where you store logic for interacting with 3rd-party APIs
 *
 * A few common 3rd-party APIs useful for frontend apps:
 *
 * 1. Mixpanel API
 * 2. Segment API
 * 3. Google Analytics API
 * 4. Amplitude API
 * 5. Salesforce API
 *
 * Most of these platforms/APIs provide JavaScript SDKs
 *
 * But it is important that:
 * 1. You don't end up creating too many instances of their SDK client
 * every time you need to use them
 * 2. You don't have to write too much boilerplate code just to access
 * a method / property from their SDK
 *
 * Which is why we recommend writing tiny wrappers around these SDKs,
 * this way you can avoid the problems we described above
