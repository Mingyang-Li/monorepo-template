/**
 * The 'features' folder is where you keep all the components that
 * are only used for a particular feature of your app, rather than
 * the components that're used across the app.
 *
 * For e.g,
 * 1. A data table for displaying user data UserTable />
 * can display very different data & have different functionalities
 * to a data table for displaying transactions data. This is where it
 * makes sense to place your <UserTable /> component in /feature folder
 * than keeping it in /component folder
 *
 * 2. A form for signing up a user can be very different to forms for
 * admins to create or update the user. This is when it makes sense to
 * create seperate components like <SignUpUser />, >CreateUser /> and
 * <UpdateUser /> and keep them all within the /features folder rather
 * than keeping them in /components folder
